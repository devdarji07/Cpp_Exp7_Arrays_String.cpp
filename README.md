# * Experiment 07 – Arrays and Strings in C++

##  Aim
To study and implement the concepts of **arrays** and **strings** in C++ through various operations and algorithms.

---

##  Apparatus Required
- Visual Studio / Code::Blocks / Dev-C++ (or any standard C++ IDE or compiler)

---

##  Theory

###  Arrays in C++
An **array** is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.  
Elements are accessed using indices starting from `0`.

Arrays allow:
- Easy handling of large data sets
- Efficient implementation of algorithms

#### ✅ Types of Arrays:
- **One-Dimensional Array** – Linear collection of elements.
- **Multi-Dimensional Array** – Arrays of arrays (e.g., 2D matrix).

####  Common Algorithms with Arrays:
- **Linear Search** – Search for an element sequentially.
- **Finding Min/Max** – Traverse array to find smallest/largest element.
- **Array Reversal** – Swap elements from start to end.
- **Sorting** – (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)

---

###  Strings in C++
Strings can be implemented using:
1. **Character Arrays** (`char str[]`)
2. **`std::string` Class** (recommended in modern C++)

The `std::string` class automatically handles:
- Memory allocation
- Null termination
- Copying

####  Common String Functions:
- `strcpy()` – Copies one string to another.
- `strcat()` – Concatenates two strings.
- `strlen()` – Returns string length.
- `strcmp()` – Compares two strings.

##  Implementation Tasks
1. **Basic Array Declaration & Printing**  
2. **Searching for an Element (Linear Search)**  
3. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values**  
4. **Reversing an Array**  
5. **Using String Functions (`strcpy`, `strlen`, etc.)**  
6. **Concatenating and Comparing Strings**  

All programs are implemented using **standard C++ syntax** and **basic algorithms** like linear traversal and conditional checks.

## ✅ Conclusion
This experiment provided practical knowledge of **array and string operations** in C++.  
We learned:
- How arrays store and access data sequentially.
- How strings can be manipulated using built-in functions.
- Implementation of searching, sorting, and reversing algorithms.
- The difference between character arrays and the `std::string` class.
